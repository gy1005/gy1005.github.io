      <description>I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University, advised by Professor Christina Delimitrou. I am interested in microservices, cloud computing, computer architecture and computer systems. My research focuses on building and managing large-scale microservices in datacenters, improving their performance and resource efficiency. Before studying at Cornell, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2016.
I was a Ph.D. software engineering intern at Google in 2018 and 2019 hosted by David Lo and Sundar Dev.</description>
