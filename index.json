Detecting performance degradation a posteriori helps the system take corrective action, but does not avoid the QoS violations. Detecting QoS violations after the fact is even more detrimental when a service consists of hundreds of thousands of loosely-coupled microservices, since performance hiccups can quickly propagate across the dependency graph of microservices. In this work we focus on anticipating QoS violations in cloud settings to mitigate performance unpredictability to begin with. We propose Seer, a cloud runtime that leverages the massive amount of tracing data cloud systems collect over time and a set of practical learning techniques to signal upcoming QoS violations, as well as identify the microservice(s) causing them. Once an imminent QoS violation is detected Seer uses machine-level hardware events to determine the cause of the QoS violation, and adjusts the resource allocations to prevent it. In local clusters with 10 40-core servers and 200-instance clusters on GCE running diverse cloud microservices, we show that Seer correctly anticipates QoS violations 91% of the time, and attributes the violation to the correct microservice in 89% of cases. Finally, Seer detects QoS violations early enough for a corrective action to almost always be applied successfully.","tags":[],"title":"Seer: Leveraging Big Data to Navigate the Increasing Complexity of Cloud Debugging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Yu Gan**","Christina Delimitrou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530417600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552527587,"objectID":"b385e9d381d6975227c24b6ae1293d25","permalink":"https://gy1005.github.io/publication/2018.cal.deathstarbench/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018.cal.deathstarbench/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Architectural Implications of Cloud Microservices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Yu Gan**","Chunxiao Jiang ","Norman C.

However, it is vulnerable to spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks when malicious secondary users (SUs) report fraudulent sensing data. In order to improve the robustness, numerous attack prevention schemes have been proposed to identify malicious SUs. Nevertheless, most of them neglect to incentivize SUs to send truthful reports. An incentive method based on peer-prediction is proposed to identify malicious suspects, punish attackers, and incentivize SUs to send truthful reports simultaneously for decision fusion. Moreover, continuous peer-prediction derived from the binary case is introduced, which is capable of preventing attacks in the continuous domain. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that honest SUs are rewarded for accurate and truthful sensing results, while malicious SUs incur penalty for making falsified sensing reports. A significant improvement of detection rates is obtained by the proposed scheme when there are no more than half of malicious SUs conducting SSDF attacks.","tags":[],"title":"Secure Collaborative Spectrum Sensing: A Peer-Prediction Method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Yu Gan**","Chunxiao Jiang","Wei Zhang","Norman C.

In order to improve the robustness, numerous attack prevention schemes have been proposed to identify malicious secondary users (SUs). Nevertheless, most of them neglect to incentivize SUs to send truthful reports. Therefore, an incentive method based on Private-Prior Peer-Prediction with approximate subjective priors is proposed to identify malicious suspects and punish attackers when falsifying the sensing data simultaneously. The theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that honest SUs are rewarded by accurate and truthful sensing results while malicious SUs receive heavy loss for making falsified sensing results. Moreover, a significant improvement of detection rates is demonstrated when there are a large number of malicious SUs conducting cooperative attacks compared to the pure majority rule scheme.","tags":[],"title":"Incentive Attack Prevention for Collaborative Spectrum Sensing: A Peer-Prediction Method","type":"publication"}]
